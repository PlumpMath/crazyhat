# crazyhat

Another Simple Static Blog Engine ... written in Clojure

![crazyhat](crazyhat.png)
`crazyhat` **[work in progress]** is a simple static blog generation engine similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), but which affords more ease in working with a heirarchy of pages/directories, with each directory reflected as a page in the generated site, and with the possibility to navigate to related areas more easily.  Any page can be a blog, and there is an aggregate feed for all blog posts as well.

### Building

To build using [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen), clone and `cd` to this project, then:

    lein uberjar

### Running

To run,

    java -jar <target-dir>/crazyhat-app.jar <site-dir>

`target-dir` will probably be `./target` if you have just built the jar.

`site-dir` should have a subdirectory `markdown` in it which contains markdown files to be converted to HTML.

When any Markdown files in `site-dir/markdown` are updated, corresponding HTML files will be automatically be made in `site-dir/site`.  This includes subdirectories.

Static files (`.jpg`s, at the moment) are copied to the `site` dir when they appear.  In a future version the copy operation may be changed to a hard link (supported in Java 7).

While the application is running, files can be browsed at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/), with subdirectories specified as extra terms in the URL.

### Deployment:

    rsync -vurt <site-dir>/site user@remotehost:path/to/deploy/dir

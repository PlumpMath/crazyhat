`crazyhat` **[work in progress]** is a simple static blog generation
engine similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), but
which affords more ease in working with a heirarchy of
pages/directories, with each directory reflected as a page in the
generated site, and with the possibility to navigate to related areas
more easily. Any page can be a blog, and there is an aggregate feed
for all blog posts as well.

### Building

To build using [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen),
clone and `cd` to this project, then:

    lein uberjar

### Running

To run,

    java -jar <build-dir>/crazyhat-app.jar <dest-dir>

`build-dir` will probably be `./target` if you have just built the jar
inside the `crazyhat` directory..

`dest-dir` is a directory with your site's files. It should have a
subdirectory `markup` in it which contains markdown files to be
converted to HTML, as well as any image, CSS or JavaScript files.
`markup` can have any number of subdirectories, sub-subdirectories,
etc.; Markdown files in any of these are processed into HTML files in
`<dest-dir>/site`, preserving the directory heirarchy in `markup.`
Other files are copied to the `site` dir when they appear.[1]

### Testing

While the application is running, files can be browsed at
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/), with subdirectories
specified as extra terms in the URL.

[1] In a future version the copy operation may be changed to a hard
link (supported in Java 7).

### Deployment:

    rsync -vurt <dest-dir>/site user@remotehost:path/to/deploy/dir
